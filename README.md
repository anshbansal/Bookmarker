Bookmarker
==========
####How this project started
I always had a lot of bookmarks in my webbrowser. Folders in folders containing bookmarks. So many bookmarks that finding them after a while became a hassle and I found that really irritating. This project is the result as a way to solve this problem.

####How this project aims to solve the problem
The bookmarks will be stored by category. A webpage with search for the bookmarks will be present. Of course there will be a page for adding the bookmarks too. 

####But some solutions are alrady present for this problem
Yeah I know. Some online solutions are present for solving this. Before working this project I had not worked on a Python framework. So this project was also a learning exercise for me. Plus the community gets a Django app for this.

####Current status - Alpha
This is still very much in progress. Currently working on search page.

####Help wanted
Anyone interested in helping to improve UI please start a issue.
