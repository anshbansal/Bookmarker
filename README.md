Bookmarker
==========
####How this project started
I always had a lot of bookmarks in my webbrowser. Folders in folders containing bookmarks. So many bookmarks that finding them after a while became a hassle and I found that really irritating. This project is the result as a way to solve this problem.

####How this project aims to solve the problem
The bookmarks will be stored by category. A webpage with search for the bookmarks will be present. Of course there will be a page for adding the bookmarks too. 

####But some solutions are alrady present for this problem
Yeah I know. Some online solutions are present for solving this. Before working this project I had not worked on a Python framework. So this project was also a learning exercise for me. Plus the community gets a Django app for this.

####Current Progress
- Searching bookmarks by category works. 
- Auto-complete is present for categories to make search easier
- Being able to open bookmarks through the UI
- Working on being able to add/remove categories from the page

####Future Ideas
- Addition/Modification of bookmarks. I know this should have been done earlier :D. But I decided on search before addition
- Chrome Plugin for migrating bookmarks to the app and vice versa

####Help wanted
Anyone interested in helping to improve UI please start a issue.
